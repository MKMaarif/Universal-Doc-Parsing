Optimizing Costs Amid Rising Transportation

- Mining services and coal transportation costs remained the largest expense components.
- Mining service costs increased yoy due to higher overburden (+3% yoy), coal extraction (+3% yoy), and hauling distance. Meanwhile, coal transportation costs rose in line with increased coal transport volumes (+18% yoy).
- Cash costs have been slightly increased due to coal transportation cost and longer hauling distance both overburden removal or coal getting.
