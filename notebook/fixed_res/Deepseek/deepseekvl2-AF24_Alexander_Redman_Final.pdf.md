# Chasing China?

Five reasons to chase the China rally: 
1. Bullish technical signals for an index breakout
2. Both the HSCEI and CSI300 have formed a ‘golden cross’ (50dma moving above the 200dma).

- **50-day moving average**: The light blue line represents the 50-day moving average. It also shows a downward trend but with more volatility than the 200-day moving average.

### CSI300 versus 200- and 50-day moving averages
