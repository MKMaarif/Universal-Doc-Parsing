Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [3][24][15].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states \\(h_{t}\\), as a function of the previous hidden state \\(h_{t-1}\\) and the input for position \\(t\\). This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [31], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2][19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n# Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [13] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4][27][28][22].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17][18] and [9].\n\n# Model Architecture\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5][2][35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations \\((x_{1},...,x_{n})\\) to a sequence of continuous representations \\(\\mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n})\\). Given \\(\\mathbf{z}\\), the decoder then generates an output sequence \\((y_{1},...,y_{m})\\) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next."

Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(\\( x + \\text{Sublayer}(x) \\)), where Sublayer(\\( x \\)) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension \\( d_{\\text{model}} = 512 \\).\n\n**Decoder:**\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of \\( N = 6 \\) identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position \\( i \\) can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than \\( i \\).\n\n---\n\n### Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum"

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension \\(d_k\\), and values of dimension \\(d_v\\). We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by \\(\\sqrt{d_k}\\), and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix \\(Q\\). The keys and values are also packed together into matrices \\(K\\) and \\(V\\). We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V\n\\]\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\). Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of \\(d_k\\) the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of \\(d_k\\)[3]. We suspect that for large values of \\(d_k\\), the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients [4]. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\).\n\n---\n\n### 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with \\(d_{model}$-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values \\(h\\) times with different, learned linear projections to \\(d_k\\), \\(d_k\\) and \\(d_v\\) dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding \\(d_v$-dimensional"

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension \\(d_{\\text{model}}\\) as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\n\\[ PE_{(pos,2i)} = \\sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}}) \\]\n\\[ PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = \\cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}}) \\]\n\nwhere \\(pos\\) is the position and \\(i\\) is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from \\(2\\pi\\) to \\(10000 \\cdot 2\\pi\\). We chose this function because we hypothesize it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset \\(k\\), \\(PE_{pos+k}\\) can be represented as a linear function of \\(PE_{pos}\\).\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n---\n\n### Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations \\((x_1,...,x_n)\\) to another sequence of equal length \\((z_1,...,z_n)\\), with \\(x_i, z_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\), such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1 a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires \\(O(n)\\) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence"

            "markdown": "# Training\n\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n### 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n### 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models (described on the bottom line of table[7], step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n### 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with \\(\\beta_1 = 0.9\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0.98\\) and \\(\\epsilon = 10^{-9}\\). We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lrate} = d_{\\text{model}}^{-0.5} \\cdot \\min(\\text{step\\_num}^{-0.5}, \\text{step\\_num} \\cdot \\text{warmup\\_steps}^{-1.5})\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup_steps = 4000.\n\n### 5.4 Regularization\n\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:"

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of P_drop = 0.1.\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value \u03b5_ls = 0.1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n\n6 Results\n\n6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)) in Table 2 outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate P_drop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty \u03b1 = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\n\n6.2 Model Variations\n\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the"

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The approach is designed to improve the performance of statistical machine translation by capturing the context and meaning of phrases in a sequence. The method involves training the RNN on a large dataset of parallel texts and then using it to generate translations for new sentences. The results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional statistical machine translation approaches in terms of translation quality and fluency.\n\n**Keywords:** Recurrent Neural Networks, Language Modeling, Statistical Machine Translation\n\n**Categories:** Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval\n\n**References:**\n- [1] Cho, K., Van Merrienboer, B., Gulcehre, C., Bougares, F., Schwenk, H., Bengio, Y.
