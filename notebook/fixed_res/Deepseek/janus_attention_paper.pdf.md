## Abstract
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long-term dependencies. These models are also connected to the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show that these models outperform the recurrent neural network (RNN) baseline and the encoder-decoder RNN baseline. The training of these models is much faster than the RNN baseline, and the performance is comparable to the encoder-decoder RNN baseline. The training of these models is much faster than the RNN baseline, and the performance is comparable to the encoder-decoder RNN baseline.

# Introduction

Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, which is crucial for tasks such as language modeling and machine translation. However, the training of these models can be challenging due to the vanishing gradient problem, which limits the ability of the model to learn long-term dependencies.

Recent research has focused on developing architectures that can overcome this limitation. One such approach is the Transformer, which was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. [1]. The Transformer architecture relies on the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence. This mechanism enables the model to capture long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional recurrent neural networks.

In this work, we propose the Transformer, a novel architecture combining recurrence and mutual information. The Transformer is based on the Transformer architecture, but with a modified recurrence mechanism that incorporates mutual information. We demonstrate that the Transformer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, including machine translation quality after being trained for a little as twelve hours on eight NVIDIA GPUs.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), have been widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, which is crucial for tasks such as language modeling and machine translation. However, the training of these models can be challenging due to the vanishing gradient problem, which limits the ability of the model to learn long-term dependencies.

We demonstrate that the Transformer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, including machine translation quality after being trained for a little as twelve hours on eight NVIDIA GPUs.

## 3 Model Architecture

Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder is typically a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer, which processes the input sequence and generates a sequence of hidden states. The decoder is also typically an RNN or a transformer, which generates the output sequence one token at a time.

In this work, we propose the Translator, a novel architecture that combines recurrence and mutual information. The Translator is based on the Transformer architecture, but with a modified recurrence mechanism that incorporates mutual information. The Translator consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is a Transformer that takes the input sequence and generates a sequence of hidden states. The decoder is also a Transformer that generates the output sequence one token at a time.

The Translator is trained using a masked language modeling objective, which is similar to the original Transformer. However, the Translator also incorporates a masked self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to learn to predict the masked tokens in the input sequence.

### Encoder and Decoder Stacks

### Encoder

The encoder is composed of a stack \( V \times S \) of identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers:

1. **Positional Encoding**: This sub-layer adds positional information to the input embeddings.
2. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: This sub-layer performs multi-head self-attention to capture dependencies between the input embeddings.

The output of each sub-layer is passed through a linear transformation and a ReLU activation function.

### Decoder

The decoder is composed of a stack \( V \times S \) of identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers:

1. **Positional Encoding**: This sub-layer adds positional information to the input embeddings.
2. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: This sub-layer performs multi-head self-attention to capture dependencies between the input embeddings.
3. **Multi-Head Attention**: This sub-layer performs multi-head attention to capture dependencies between the output of the encoder and the decoder.

The output of each sub-layer is passed through a linear transformation and a ReLU activation function.

## Attention

An attention function is as described in mapping a query and set of of-put-clause pairs to an output vector. The output of the attention function is used as the query vector.

# Table 1: Maximum path length, per-layer complexity, and minimum number of sequential operations

## Self-Attention

| Layer Type | Complexity per Layer | Sequential | Maximum Path Length |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Self-Attention | O(n^2)                | O(n)         | O(n)                  |
| Self-Attention (masked) | O(n^2) + O(n)         | O(n)         | O(n)                  |

## Per-Pixel Encoding

| Layer Type | Complexity per Layer | Sequential | Maximum Path Length |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Per-Pixel Encoding | O(n^2)                | O(n)         | O(n)                  |

## Why Self-Attention?

Self-attention layers are widely used in the recurrent and convolutional neural layers. They allow us to map our variable length sequences of crafted representations into a fixed-length vector.

Self-attention layers are particularly useful for mapping our variable length sequences of crafted representations into a fixed-length vector. This is because the self-attention mechanism allows the model to learn the dependencies between the input elements.

The self-attention mechanism is also able to learn dependencies in the length of the input forward and backward signals. This is because the self-attention mechanism is able to learn the dependencies in the length of the input forward and backward signals.

The maximum path length between any pair input signal position in networks composed of self-attention layers is O(n). This is because the maximum path length between any pair input signal position in networks composed of self-attention layers is O(n).

# Natural Language and Vision Assistant

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the natural language and vision assistant developed by the assistant. The assistant is designed to understand visual content and assist users with a variety of tasks using natural language.

## Training

### 1. Training Data

We trained our models on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset, consisting of about 4.5 million sentences. We also used the English-French dataset, which contains about 3500k sentences.

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning

We used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 16, and a learning rate scheduler with a learning rate of 0.001, a decay of 0.99, and a warm-up of 100 epochs.

## Registration

### Types of Registration During Training

We used a simple linear schedule for the learning rate, with a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 16, and a learning rate scheduler with a learning rate of 0.001, a decay of 0.99, and a warm-up of 100 epochs.

## Conclusion

The Transformer model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers with convolutional layers, and encoder-decoder architecture with self-attention mechanism, has achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT 2014 English-German, WMT 2014 English-French, and WMT 2018 English-French translation tasks. We are excited to see the Transformer model can be applied to other tasks. We are excited to investigate the extended attention mechanism to efficiently handle large-scale and sequential data.

# Attention Visualizations

## Figure 1: An example of the attention mechanism following long-distance dependencies in the 3D attention head of the transformer.

## Subtext:

In Figure 1, we show an example of the attention mechanism following long-distance dependencies in the 3D attention head of the transformer. The attention weights are visualized as a heatmap, where the x-axis and y-axis represent the input tokens. The color intensity represents the attention weights, with darker colors indicating higher attention weights. The color bar on the right side of the figure shows the range of attention weights.

## Subtext:

The attention mechanism is a key component of the transformer model, which has been shown to be effective in capturing long-range dependencies in the input data. In this example, we can see that the attention weights are distributed across the input tokens, indicating that the model is able to capture dependencies between tokens that are far apart in the input sequence.

## Subtext:

The attention mechanism has been shown to be effective in improving the performance of transformer models in various tasks, including machine translation, text classification, and question answering. However, it can also be challenging to interpret the attention weights, as they can be very large and difficult to visualize.
