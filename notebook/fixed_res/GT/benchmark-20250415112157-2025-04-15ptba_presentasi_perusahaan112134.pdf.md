- Revenue rose by 11% yoy and 10% qoq, driven by a robust increase in sales, particularly in exports, which rose to 30% in this year.
- ASP remained stable throughout the year but appears lower than the previous year due to an increase in mine-mouth sales, which grew by 74% yoy

## Cost Control in Mind

Cash costs increased on a yearly basis due to an inflated transportation cost and longer hauling distance.

### Optimizing Costs Amid Rising Transportation

- Mining services and coal transportation costs remained the largest expense components. Mining service costs increased yoy due to higher overburden (+3% yoy), coal extraction (+3% yoy), and hauling distance. Meanwhile, coal transportation costs rose in line with increased coal transport volumes (+18% yoy)
- Cash costs have been slightly increased due to coal transportation cost and longer hauling distance both overburden removal or coal getting

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons.

These forward-looking statements reflect current views about future events, are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and are, by their nature, subject to significant risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including levels of exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; levels and calculations of reserves and material differences from reserves estimates; regulatory stability and access to resources, including attractive low carbon opportunities; the effects of climate change and changes in stakeholder sentiment and regulatory requirements regarding climate change; changes in market demand and supply; inability to meet strategic objectives; the development and use of new technology; social and/or political instability, including as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East; failure to prevent or manage digital and cyber disruptions to our information and operational technology systems and those of third parties on which we rely; operational problems, including cost inflation in capital and operational expenditures; unsuccessful drilling; availability of adequate infrastructure at commercially viable prices; the actions of field partners and other third-parties; reputational damage; the actions of competitors; the actions of the Government of Republic of Indonesia as majority shareholder and exercise of ownership by Government of Republic of Indonesia ; changes or uncertainty in or non compliance with laws and governmental regulations; adverse changes in tax regimes; the political and economic policies of Indonesia and other coal-producing countries; liquidity, interest rate, equity and credit risks; risk of losses relating to trading and commercial supply activities; an inability to attract and retain personnel; ineffectiveness of crisis management systems; inadequate insurance coverage; health, safety and environmental risks; physical security risks to personnel, assets, infrastructure and operations from hostile or malicious acts; failure to meet our ethical and social standards; non-compliance with international trade sanctions; and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in PTBA's Annual Report. PTBA's Annual Report is available at PTBA’s website www.ptba.co.id.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our future results, level of activity, performance or achievements will meet these expectations. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any of these statements after the date of this report, either to make them conform to actual results or changes in our expectations.
