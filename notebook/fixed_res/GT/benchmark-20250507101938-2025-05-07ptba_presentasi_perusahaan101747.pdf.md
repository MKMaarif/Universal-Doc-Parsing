## Coal Transportation & Sales

There was a train track derailment in January, which results to lose opportunity for delivery about ~300k ton coal. Both coal transportation and sales grew on a yearly basis.

### Coal Transportation
(in million tons)

#### QoQ

| Quarter | KAI  | Non-KAI | Change |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| 4Q2024  | 9.01 | 1.33    | -      |
| 1Q2025  | 8.54 | 0.87    | -9%    |

#### YoY

| Quarter | KAI  | Non-KAI | Change |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| 1Q2024  | 8.43 | -       | -      |
| 1Q2025  | 8.54 | 0.87    | +12%   |

* Coal transportation realization was just shy of our quarterly target due to a train track derailment.

* Improvement on a yearly basis due to a contribution from trucking, while during the same period last year, trucking delivery had not yet started.

### Sales
(in million tons)

#### QoQ

| Quarter | Total | Domestic | Export | Change |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 4Q2024  | 11.61 | 5.65     | 5.96   | -      |
| 1Q2025  | 10.28 | 5.19     | 5.09   | -11%   |

#### YoY

| 1Q2025  | 10.28 | 5.19     | 5.09   | +7%    |

* Sales performance was weaker on a quarterly basis, but still in line with production and coal transportation performance.

* On a yearly basis, we recorded a solid growth in sales volume and export portion.

## Revenue & Average Selling Price

Export performance was a key driver of revenue, supporting sustained growth despite weakening coal prices on both a quarterly and yearly basis.

### Revenue
(in Billion Rupiah)

| Quarter  | QoQ Value | YoY Value  |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 4Q2024   | 12.11     | 9.41       |
| 1Q2025   | 9.96      | 9.96       |


### Average Selling Price

**0.95**

Rupiah per Ton

QoQ **-7%**

YoY **-1%**

### Coal Price ICI-3

**69.37**

USD per Ton

QoQ **-7%**

YoY **-12%**


* On a yearly basis, despite ICI-3 has decreased, our revenue increased. It was solely driven by a strong export sales portion compared to the same period last year (50% vs 39%).

* On a quarterly basis, revenue has fallen due to lower export volume and weakened coal prices.

# Cost Breakdown & Cash Cost

Cash costs increased on both quarterly and yearly basis due to an inflated fuel cost and weakened IDR to USD exchange

## Cost Breakdown

| Category                 | 1Q2024 (%) | 1Q2025 (%) |
|--------------------------|------------|------------|
| Mining Services          | 24         | 27         |
| Transportation           | 24         | 24         |
| Royalty & Retribution    | 11         | 10         |
| Fuel**                   | 4          | 10         |
| Remuneration             | 6          | 6          |
| Inventory                | 16         | 6          |
| Depreciation & Amortization | 5          | 5          |
| Others*                  | 10         | 12         |

## Cash Cost
(in Million Rupiah per Ton)

| Quarter  | QoQ Value | YoY Value  |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 4Q2024   | 0.86      | 0.87       |
| 1Q2025   | 0.90      | 0.90       |

## Drivers of Rising Cost

| Quarter  | Fuel Price | USD Rate  |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1Q2024   | 13,718    | 15,664     |
| 1Q2025   | 15,127    | 16,359     |

* Rising in fuel price was caused by the removal of B40â€™s subsidy and the depreciation of the IDR against the USD

* Since fuel components are spread across several unit cost categories, the increase can be observed in mining service costs, transportation costs, and of course, fuel costs.

/* Including third party services, equipment rentals, spare parts, and community development 

/** Fuel costs rise significantly due to higher fuel prices and reclassification of fuel costs from coal transportation costs (-Rp400 Billion)

## Net Profit & EBITDA

### Despite many obstacles throughout the quarter, the bottom line remains positive.

| Quarter | Net Profit (Billion Rupiah) | QoQ | YoY |
|----------|----------------------------|-----|-----|
| 4Q2024   | 1.87                       | -   | -   |
| 1Q2025   | 0.39                       | -79%| -   |
| 1Q2024   | 0.79                       | -   | -   |
| 1Q2025   | 0.39                       | -   | -51%|

| Quarter | EBITDA (Billion Rupiah) | QoQ | YoY |
|----------|-------------------------|-----|-----|
| 4Q2024   | 2.68                    | -   | -   |
| 1Q2025   | 1.05                    | -60%| -   |
| 1Q2024   | 1.51                    | -   | -   |
| 1Q2025   | 1.05                    | -   | -50%|

* Pressure from declining coal prices and rising COGSâ€”especially fuelâ€”massively hit our bottom line on both quarterly and yearly basis.
