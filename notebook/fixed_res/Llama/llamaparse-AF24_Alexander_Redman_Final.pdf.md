# Asean, China and EM

## Asean: Order of merit

- We are unconvinced recent price action has longevity. Stay benchmark.

## The case for EM
- EM equities have underwhelmed versus DM. We see room for improvement.

# Indonesia (40% overweight)

- Dissimilar external balances and sector mix ensure strong counter-cyclicality with North Asia.
- Yet a strong forecast bounce in credit impulse is consistent with an uplift in market momentum.

## MSCI Indonesia/EM versus MSCI North Asia*/EM (US$, rebased)

| Date Range      | MSCI Indonesia/EM (LHS) | MSCI North Asia\*/EM (RHS) |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Jan 02 - Jan 23 | 15 - 165 (Left axis)    | 65 - 115 (Right axis)      |

The graph shows fluctuating trends for both MSCI Indonesia/EM and MSCI North Asia*/EM from January 2002 to January 2023. The Indonesia/EM line (light blue) shows more volatility and generally higher values, while the North Asia*/EM line (dark blue) shows less dramatic fluctuations.

## Indonesia credit impulse versus equity market momentum

| Date Range      | Indonesia credit impulse (lagged by 9m, LHS) | Jakarta composite (yoy % chg, RHS) |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Jan 03 - Jan 27 | -6% to 4% (Left axis)                        | -75% to 75% (Right axis)           |

This graph compares Indonesia's credit impulse (lagged by 9 months) with the Jakarta composite year-over-year percentage change from January 2003 to January 2027. The credit impulse (dark blue line) shows less extreme fluctuations compared to the more volatile Jakarta composite (light blue line).

# Indonesia (40% overweight)

- Indonesia's funding gap has dropped well below the level associated with rupiah stability.
- But inward FDI (EV industry, other manufacturing, infrastructure) may rise to 1.5% of GDP.

# Indonesia (40% overweight)

- Two surprise BI rate increases have taken real interest rates to the top of the historical range.
- Yet the recovery in real retail sales is following the uplift in confidence and tourism arrivals.

## Indonesia inflation versus nominal and real interest rates

| Date   | B.I. policy rate (%) | Real interest rate (%) | CPI yoy inflation (%) |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Jan 10 | \~6.5                | \~3                    | \~4                   |
| Jan 24 | \~6.3                | \~3.2                  | \~3.1                 |

The graph shows fluctuations in the B.I. policy rate, real interest rate, and CPI year-over-year inflation from January 2010 to January 2024. The B.I. policy rate has remained relatively stable in recent years, while the real interest rate and inflation have shown more variability.

## Indonesia consumer confidence vs real retail sales growth

| Date   | Indonesia real retail sales growth (season. adj., LHS) | Indonesia consumer confidence index (RHS) |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Jan 04 | \~10%                                                  | \~100                                     |

The graph illustrates the relationship between Indonesia's real retail sales growth (seasonally adjusted) and the consumer confidence index from January 2004 to January 2024. Both metrics show significant fluctuations over time, with recent trends indicating an increase in consumer confidence and a recovery in retail sales growth.

## EM private non-financial sector debt service ratios

The graph shows debt service ratios for various emerging market countries from January 2000 to January 2024. The countries included are:

- Brazil (highest, peaking around 30% in early 2000s)
- Korea
- China
- Thailand
- Malaysia
- India
- Indonesia (lowest, consistently below 10%)

The graph indicates that Indonesia has maintained the lowest debt service ratio among these countries over the entire period, staying below 10%. This supports the statement about Indonesia's modest debt service ratio potentially catalyzing credit growth recovery.

# Malaysia (60% underweight)

- ROE is 25%-30% inferior to EM while the price book discount to EM is only around 15%.
- We see no relative improvement in relative value creation, which drives relative performance.

## Malaysia relative PBR and ROE

## 2. Confidence remains depleted in the bellwether property sector

There is up to 10Y worth of inventory (unsold housing starts & property bought speculatively).

### China property starts and sales vs annual change to urban population

| Legend          |                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light blue bars | China ann. change in urban pop. (m, RHS)                         |
| Dark blue line  | Residential real estate dev. new starts (12m rolling, mn sq. m.) |
| Light blue line | Residential real estate dev. space sold (12m rolling, mn sq. m.) |

The graph shows data from Jan 90 to Jan 40 (projected). The left y-axis ranges from 0 to 2,000, while the right y-axis ranges from 10 to 25. The graph depicts a rise in both new starts and space sold from 2000 to 2020, peaking around 2020, followed by a sharp decline.

### China residential real estate inventory (months of unsold starts)

| Legend          |                                                                                    |

| Dark blue line  | Housing starts to demand ratio (RHS)                                               |

The graph shows data from Jan 06 to Jan 24. The left y-axis ranges from 18 to 42, while the right y-axis ranges from 65% to 165%. Both lines show cyclical patterns, with the housing starts to demand ratio declining sharply from 2021 to 2024.

- There is also constraint on the magnitude of any fiscal stimulus given a c.8% of GDP deficit.

- Public sector debt at 85% of GDP has risen by 45ppt over 10Y, more than any EM or DM.

## China fiscal outlook

| !China fiscal outlook graph |   |

This graph shows three lines representing different fiscal metrics for China from 2004 to 2028:
1. China general govt net lending/borrowing (% GDP)
2. China general govt structural balance* (% potential GDP)
3. China general govt primary net lending/borrowing (% GDP)

The graph shows all three metrics declining from around 0% in 2004 to about -8% by 2028, with a sharp drop around 2019-2022.

*Cyclically adjusted balance omitting non-structural elements beyond the economic cycle.

## China general government debt (% GDP)

| !China general government debt graph |   |

This stacked area chart shows the composition of China's general government debt as a percentage of GDP from January 2014 to January 2024. The debt is divided into three categories:

1. Local Govt. debt
2. Central Govt. debt
3. LGFV debt

The total debt has increased from about 40% of GDP in January 2014 to nearly 90% by January 2024, with all three categories showing growth over the period.

# The case for EM

- Since 2021 EM ex China has kept pace with Japan yet underperformed the S&P500 by 33%.

- In contrast with the tepid mood on EM, we find an abundance of macro data points to rejoice.

## MSCI China, MSCI EM ex China, S&P500 and TOPIX total return (1/1/2021=100)

| Index            | Description                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| S\&P500          | US$ total return, 1/1/21=100 |
| TOPIX            | US$ total return, 1/1/21=100 |
| MSCI EM ex China | US$ total return, 1/1/21=100 |
| MSCI China       | US$ total return, 1/1/21=100 |

The graph shows the performance of these four indices from January 2016 to January 2025 (projected). Key observations:

1. S&P500 shows the strongest performance, especially from 2021 onwards, reaching around 150 by Jan 2025.
2. TOPIX and MSCI EM ex China follow similar trajectories, ending slightly above 100 by Jan 2025.
3. MSCI China shows the most volatility, with significant drops after Jan 2021, ending around 75 by Jan 2025.
4. All indices show a sharp drop around Jan 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but recover afterwards.
5. The MSCI China index underperforms compared to the other indices, particularly after Jan 2021.

# The case for EM

There is a reassuringly strong association between YoY EM momentum and the EM policy bias.

Also the spread between nominal GDP growth and rates is signaling positive EM momentum.

# The case for EM

- EM EPS growth recovery is being driven by North Asia (semis in particular), Mexico and China.
- However, EPS revisions remain negative and disappointment remains likely for China growth.

## Emerging market earnings revisions vs performance momentum

The graph shows two lines from January 2000 to January 2024:

1. EM EPS revisions (%, LHS): Fluctuates between approximately -10% and 10%, with significant volatility.
2. MSCI EM (US$, yoy % chg, RHS): Ranges from about -60% to 60%, showing high volatility and generally following a similar pattern to the EPS revisions, but with larger swings.

The graph indicates a correlation between earnings revisions and market performance in emerging markets, with both metrics experiencing significant fluctuations over the past two decades.

The left chart shows the CAPE (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings) ratio for the S&P500 and MSCI EM from January 1990 to January 2020. The S&P500 CAPE has generally been higher, reaching peaks around 45 in 2000 and 35-40 in recent years. The MSCI EM CAPE has been more volatile but generally lower, currently around 10-15.

The right chart displays the MSCI EM/World +12m P/E ratio as a percentage from January 1990 to January 2022. It includes a 34.5Y average line and +/-1 standard deviation bands. The ratio has fluctuated between about 50% and 130%, with recent values around 70-80%, below the long-term average.
