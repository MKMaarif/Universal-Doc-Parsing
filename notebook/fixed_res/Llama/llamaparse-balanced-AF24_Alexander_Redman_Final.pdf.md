EM equities have underwhelmed versus DM: We see room to improve. Contrasting with the pervasive tepid mood on the relative fortunes of EM equities (much related to China), we find an abundance of macro data points to celebrate. EM rates are below DM for the first time; EM policy bias is already accommodative; the EM/DM GDP growth spread is expanding and EMs' new orders-to-inventories ratio is the highest in three years. EM IP growth over DM is above the threshold consistent with EM outperformance. EM PMI surveys lead the global recovery and EM has amongst the cheapest (on PPP) ex China FX valuation in history. Consensus 2024/5 EPS growth forecasts strongly favour EM, valuations are supportive; yet foreign investor exposure remains low: There are some risks yet much to rejoice.

# Market Strategy

Global EM rates are below DM for the first time and macro drivers strongly favour EM. On consensus projections, EM (cap-weighted) nominal rates will remain below those of DM throughout the rest of 2024. Even accounting for the surprise April tightening by Bank Indonesia, our EM (ex-China) monetary policy bias indicator is already in net accommodative territory (first time since March 2021), typically consistent with positive EM equity momentum.

# Chasing China?

We are unconvinced recent price action has longevity: Stay benchmark. Should investors chase the recent rally? That was foremost among concerns voiced by US/Canadian clients we met last week; who mostly shared our scepticism on its sustainability. While bullish technicals returning foreign inflows diminish, our macroeconomic regression models for the MSCI EM and SEPSOO indices signal stronger 12-month upside in USD for EM (+10%) relative to US equities (+3%). EM has superior 2024/5 EPS growth outlook and supportive relative valuation.

# Cycles in the spread of EM/DM real interest rates

Typically lead the EM over DM EPS growth differential, with the current spread validating the 2024 Street estimate regarding demanding consensus EPS growth expectations, the ongoing property crisis, lack of rebalancing towards consumption, deflation hindering top-line growth over DM EPS growth differential is a determinant of relative performance. Thus on consensus projections, the parable relative EPS growth profile for 2024/5 to that of 2016/18 should be matched by commensurate phase of EM outperformance.

# Market outlook

The HSCEI and CSI 300 50-day moving averages have crossed above their 200-day averages, forming a bullish 'golden cross'. Foreign investors have recommitted to Chinese equities (cumulative 13-week net purchases are USD 11.6bn) following the strongest episode of foreign net selling of China shares in a decade during 2H23. Despite an overall balance positive EM backdrop, there are risks to the narrative. Risks are both endogenous (scope for a China-related policy error) and exogenous (slowing US disinflation; US credit outlook; Trump presidency and geopolitics).

# Singapore: Plain sailing

Profitability uplift has peaked forever the yield play: Stay benchmark. CLSA's country level allocation for emerging Asian markets (see Appendix) supported by tactical yield trade and policymakers backstopping the market. We prefer Korea, India, Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand over China and Malaysia. Singapore market performance has traditionally acted as a regional proxy and, true to form, has kept pace with Asia Pacific (ex Japan) for the past three years.

# Sector composition

More play for: EM equity momentum lagging the climbing EM new orders to inventories ratio combined USD 36bn of stock in the past 12 months. 'National team' state funds intervened heavily in equities through 1Q24, deploying 65% of index weight. The bulk of the USD 11.6bn of net buying of domestic share ETFs over the quarter: dependable yield play, yet Singapore also trades on attractive earnings-based valuations and in neighbourhood of FX volatility, the Singapore dollar offers an oasis of stability.

# Global Equity Strategy

Equity momentum drivers are neutral to positive while the ROE uplift has peaked. The credit impulse and export growth outlook; long-helpful determinants for equity momentum; are indicative of only flat to marginally positive 12-month index trajectory. Moreover, we argue Singapore's elevated precautionary savings, households shy away from spending: deflation hinders top-line growth and potential Trump part two threatens trade.
