# Asean, China and EM

## Asean: Order of merit
- Establishing a strategic framework for portfolio allocation across the region.

## Chasing China?
- We are unconvinced recent price action has longevity. Stay benchmark.

## The case for EM
- EM equities have underwhelmed versus DM. We see room for improvement.

## Thailand (10% overweight)

We anticipate a recovery in credit growth following the only postGFC contraction in 2023.

This translates to marked recovery in the credit impulse, which the market is ignoring for now.

Malaysia (60% underweight)

- A higher oil price no longer supports the ringgit given the total erosion of net energy exports.
- The deterioration in Malaysia's external position is consistent with continued MYR weakness.

Malaysia (60% underweight)

We anticipate only a marginally positive credit impulse consistent with a meagre equity return.

Malaysia’s debt service ratio is high relative to the EM average and leverage already elevated.

Chasing China?

There is also constraint on the magnitude of any fiscal stimulus given a c.8% of GDP deficit. Public sector debt at 85% of GDP has risen by 45ppt over 10Y, more than any EM or DM.

## The case for EM

- Across EM conditions are ripe for policymakers to begin easing, albeit waiting for the Fed cut.
- EM real interest rates are at a 50bps positive spread over DM, or a lesser 30bps ex China.

## The case for EM

- EM equities can catch up with EM bonds which have been outperforming since July 2022.
- EM equities typically rally with a steepening global yield curve precipitated via easing.

## The case for EM

### 2. Macro drivers strongly favour EM over DM

EM relative performance is lagging the GDP growth differential expanding in favour of EM.

## The case for EM

- EM momentum is chasing the improvement in the region's new orders to inventories ratio.
- EM IP is above the critical 4ppt positive spread to DM, usually consistent with outperformance.

## The case for EM

- In May more than half of global PMIs were in expansionary territory, the first time since 3Q22.
- With the greatest concentration of surveys showing expansionary conditions in EM.

## The case for EM

- Speculative positions show market participants no longer believe the dollar is a one-way trade.
- The GDP weighted deviation from PPP for EM ex China is just above the three-decade low.
