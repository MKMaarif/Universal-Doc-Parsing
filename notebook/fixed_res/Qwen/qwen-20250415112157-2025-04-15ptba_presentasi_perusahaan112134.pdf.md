# Increasing Our Export Portion

The export portion increased this year as a strategic response to counter the weakening coal price and to leverage the USD rate recovery.

## PTBA – Coal Market Share

The export portion exceeded guidance this quarter
- Supported by external demand, export performance grew by 30% yoy.
- India (+32% yoy), Vietnam (+250% yoy), Malaysia (+221% yoy), Thailand (+153% yoy), Bangladesh (+82% yoy) and Taiwan (+76% yoy) showed significant increases in demand compared to the same period last year.

# Consistent Revenue Growth

Sales growth was notably driven by exports, contributing to sustained positive revenue growth.

The downturn in the coal index than the preceding year have inhibited revenue growth; however,

- Revenue rose by 11% yoy and 10% qoq, driven by a robust increase in sales, particularly in exports, which rose to 30% in this year.
- ASP remained stable throughout the year but appears lower than the previous year due to an increase in mine-mouth sales, which grew by 74% yoy

| Export 47% |
| Dom - PLN 36% |
| Dom - Mine Mouth 9% |

# Cost Control in Mind

Cash costs increased on a yearly basis due to an inflated transportation cost and longer hauling distance.

## Optimizing Costs Amid Rising Transportation
- Mining services and coal transportation costs remained the largest expense components.
  - Mining service costs increased yoy due to higher overburden (+3% yoy), coal extraction (+3% yoy), and hauling distance.
  - Coal transportation costs rose in line with increased coal transport volumes (+18% yoy)
- Cash costs have been slightly increased due to coal transportation cost and longer hauling distance both overburden removal or coal getting
