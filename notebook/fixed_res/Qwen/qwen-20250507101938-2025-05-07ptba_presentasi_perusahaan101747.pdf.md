## Coal Transportation
(in million tons)

| QoQ | YoY |
| --- | --- |
| ![](coal_transportation_qoq.png) | ![](coal_transportation_yoy.png) |

- Coal transportation realization was just shy of our quarterly target due to a train track derailment.
- Improvement on a yearly basis due to a contribution from trucking, while during the same period last year, trucking delivery had not yet started.

## Sales
(in million tons)

| QoQ | YoY |
| --- | --- |
| ![](sales_qoq.png) | ![](sales_yoy.png) |

- Sales performance was weaker on a quarterly basis, but still in line with production and coal transportation performance.
- On a yearly basis, we recorded a solid growth in sales volume and export portion.

---

# Sales Area & Portion

India remained our top export destination, followed by Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Thailand. Meanwhile, China moved out of our top five, and we penetrated a new Market in Romania.

## Top Five Export Sales Destination (% out of total export)
1. India → **24** percent
2. Bangladesh → **23** percent
3. Vietnam → **18** percent
4. Thailand → **10** percent
5. Philippines → **10** percent

## Sales Portion (in %)

- Dom - Others: 7%
- Dom - Mine Mouth: 9%
- Dom - PLN: 34%
- Export: 50%

**Sales Area**
(Q12025)

![Map of Sales Area](https://example.com/sales_area_map.png "Map showing sales area for Q1 2025")

# Revenue & Average Selling Price

Export performance was a key driver of revenue, supporting sustained growth despite weakening coal prices on both a quarterly and yearly basis.

| QoQ | YoY |
| --- | --- |
| **12.11** | **9.41** |
| **9.96** | **9.96** |

- **Revenue (in Billion Rupiah)**

| QoQ | YoY |
| --- | --- |
| **12.11** | **9.41** |
| **9.96** | **9.96** |

| Average Selling Price | Coal Price ICI-3 |
| --- | --- |
| **0.95** | **69.37** |
| **Rupiah per Ton** | **USD per Ton** |

| QoQ | YoY |
| --- | --- |
| **-7%** | **-1%** |
| **-7%** | **-12%** |

- **Average Selling Price**
- **Coal Price ICI-3**

• On a yearly basis, despite ICI-3 has decreased, our revenue increased. It was solely driven by a strong export sales portion compared to the same period last year (50% vs 39%).

• On a quarterly basis, revenue has fallen due to lower export volume and weakened coal prices.

---

# Cost Breakdown & Cash Cost

## Cash costs increased on both quarterly and yearly basis due to an inflated fuel cost and weakened IDR to USD exchange

### Cost Breakdown

| Category | 1Q2024 (%) | 1Q2025 (%) |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Mining Services | 24% | 27% |
| Transportation | 24% | 24% |
| Royalty & Retribution | 11% | 10% |
| Fuel** | 4% | 6% |
| Remuneration | 6% | 10% |
| Inventory | 16% | 6% |
| Depreciation & Amortization | 5% | 5% |
| Others* | 10% | 12% |

### Cash Cost

| QoQ | YoY |
|-----|-----|
| 4Q2024 | 0.86 |
| 1Q2025 | 0.90 |
| +5% | +4% |
| 1Q2024 | 0.87 |
| 1Q2025 | 0.90 |
| +4% | +4% |

### Drivers of Rising Cost

#### Fuel Price

| 1Q2024 | 1Q2025 |
|--------|--------|
| 13,718 | 15,127 |
| +10% | |

#### USD Rate

| 1Q2024 | 1Q2025 |
|--------|--------|
| 15,664 | 16,359 |
| +4% | |

- Rising in fuel price was caused by the removal of B40's subsidy and the depreciation of the IDR against the USD
- Since fuel components are spread across several unit cost categories, the increase can be observed in mining service costs, transportation costs, and of course, fuel costs.

*Including third party services, equipment rentals, spare parts, and community development
**Fuel costs rise significantly due to higher fuel prices and reclassification of fuel costs from coal transportation costs (Rp400 Billion)

---

# Net Profit & EBITDA

## Despite many obstacles throughout the quarter, the bottom line remains positive.

| QoQ | YoY |
| --- | --- |
| 1.87 | 0.39 |
| **-79%** | **-51%** |

| QoQ | YoY |
| --- | --- |
| 2.65 | 1.05 |
| **-60%** | **-30%** |

- Pressure from declining coal prices and rising COGS—especially fuel—massively hit our bottom line on both quarterly and yearly basis.
