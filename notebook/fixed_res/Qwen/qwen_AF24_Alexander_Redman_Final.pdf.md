# Asean, China and EM

- **Asean: Order of merit**
  - Establishing a strategic framework for portfolio allocation across the region.
  
- **Chasing China?**
  - We are unconvinced recent price action has longevity. Stay benchmark.
  
- **The case for EM**
  - EM equities have underwhelmed versus DM. We see room for improvement.

There is a reassuringly strong association between YoY EM momentum and the EM policy bias.

Also the spread between nominal GDP growth and rates is signaling positive EM momentum.

- Across EM conditions are ripe for policymakers to begin easing, albeit waiting for the Fed cut.
- EM real interest rates are at a 50bps positive spread over DM, or a lesser 30bps ex China.

- EM equities can catch up with EM bonds which have been outperforming since July 2022.
- EM equities typically rally with a steepening global yield curve precipitated via easing.
