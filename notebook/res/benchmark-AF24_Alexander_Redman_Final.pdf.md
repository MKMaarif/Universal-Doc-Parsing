# Asean, China and EM

## Asean: Order of merit

## The case for EM
- EM equities have underwhelmed versus DM. We see room for improvement.

# Malaysia (60% underweight)

- We anticipate only a marginally positive credit impulse consistent with a meagre equity return.
- Malaysia's debt service ratio is high relative to the EM average and leverage already elevated.

# The case for EM

- EM momentum is chasing the improvement in the region's new orders to inventories ratio.
- EM IP is above the critical 4ppt positive spread to DM usually consistent with outperformance.

# The case for EM

- EM/DM real interest rate spread (inverted) leads the EM/DM EPS differential by 12 months.
- The EM/DM EPS growth differential determines relative performance. Looking like 2016 again.
