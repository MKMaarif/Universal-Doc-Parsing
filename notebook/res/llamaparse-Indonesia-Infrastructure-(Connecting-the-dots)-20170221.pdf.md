As a follow-up to our infra report (Roads to prosperity), we revisit tollroad development in Indonesia. Land clearing is faster. The number of completed kilometres on the crucial 750km Trans Java network has doubled in two years and it is set for completion in 2019. Adding that to new projects, the government's target to double the tollroad network in five years seems doable. Owing to substantial capital requirements, funding can be an issue. However, we believe private sector participation will continue to rise, as the economics continues to improve.

#### Faster land clearing
- Land clearing for tollroad projects continues to accelerate. Trans Java is 91% cleared vs only 50% in 2015 and for Trans Sumatra, it has risen to 62% from 22%.
- Eminent domain is yet to be fully enforced, but there is much more certainty about the timeline and the process.

#### Trans Java on track; more tenders coming
- Construction is accelerating; with faster land clearing and a push from government.
- "In construction" since 1988, the Trans Java network has doubled in the past two years with the 750km main corridor on track to finish in 2019 (target is 2018).
- Completion of Trans Java and Sumatra will add 841km to the current network (984km). As the gov't continues to award concessions (550km in 2016) and invite bids for new projects, its target to double the tollroad network in 5 years is doable.

#### Issue of funding for land clearing
- Currently, an issue is a limited state budget for land clearing. The gov't has resorted to a "revolving fund" scheme again but reimbursements aren't yet done.
- We hope the new government agency LMAN (State Asset Management Agency) is effective in reimbursing land clearing expenses to investors in public projects.

#### To attract more private-sector players
- As more tollroads are added to the pipeline, private-sector participation is needed as SOE tollroad investors face funding constraints given their large expansions.
- Realising this, the gov't recently launched its PINA programme – in essence, it facilitates of equity financing for private investors in key infra projects.
- Tollroad IRRs are more attractive vs other infra projects. Coupled with faster land clearing, this should entice more private players, say Astratel, to expand portfolios.
- Key potential beneficiaries include: Jasa Marga (largest operator with a 60% share in operating tollroads), Waskita Karya, and Astra (through Astratel).

### Faster land clearing

**Land clearing continued to accelerate**

Land clearing for Trans Java and Trans Sumatra network continues to pick up. When it came to power at the end of 2014, the Jokowi administration revived Trans Java - land cleared has reached 91% from only 50% in 2015. Trans Sumatra was also kick-started in mid-2015 and land clearing has reached 62%.

**Eminent domain is yet to be fully enforced**

As mentioned in our Indo infrastructure report (Roads to prosperity: Construction boom paving the way) published in August 2016, land clearing has picked up although eminent domain (the government's right to land – as stipulated in the land law that became effective in 2015) is yet to be fully enforced.

**But, much more certainty in timeline and process**

However, tollroad companies say that there is real progress and more certainty with regards to timelines. Land appraisals are also a lot more realistic – the government is willing for differentiated pricing for different blocks of land - as opposed to one price for the whole project.

**There is compensation for 'loss time'**

We have also mentioned before that project delays due to land clearing can be compensated by either tariff adjustment (when the tollroad becomes operational), or extension of the concession period.

**Local government support remains a key factor**

Lastly, enforcement by and support of local governments remain the key factors – as eminent domain is yet to be fully enforced.

**91% of Trans Java remaining sections (449km) and 62% of Trans Sumatra priority sections (393km) has been cleared**

**Certain sections need faster land clearing such as Batang-Semarang**

Overall, the progress is good – especially for the important Trans Java network – only for the Batang-Semarang tollroad, land clearing progress is lacking (see the following table), although ever since the government re-tendered this project in 2016, the pace has accelerated to 52% from 38% in 3Q16 and 20% in 1Q16.

Batang-Semarang is a key section of Trans Java as it is located in the middle of the network. The government targets the whole network to be completed in 2019. Logistics cost savings will be greatly enhanced with connectivity between different sections.

For Trans Sumatra, the land clearing progress is also encouraging and we expect it will continue to accelerate. Land clearing for this project is relatively easier (and cheaper) than Java, given lesser population; however, the area to be cleared is larger.

## Trans Java on track; more tenders

Construction is accelerating

Construction progress has accelerated as well, mostly due to faster land clearing and also a push from the government.

Some tweaks to our forecast for Trans Java 750km main corridor completion

Nonetheless, we need to make tweaks to our Trans Java forecasts due to some delays. We previously expected 49% completion of the main corridor (750km from Jakarta to Surabaya) by the end of 2016; however the actual came to 45% (or 335km).

But, still on target to be completed in 2019

Some 44km were added in 2016 – Surabaya-Mojokerto section IV (18.5km) in Mar2016; Pejagan-Pemalang section I and II (20.2km) in mid-Jun2016; and Kertosono-Mojokerto section III (5km) in Dec2016.

We expect +89km in 2017 for Trans Java

This year, we expect more sections to be added (~89km). These are mainly on the east side such as the remaining sections of Kertosono-Mojokerto, Semarang-Solo (Bawen-Salatiga), and some sections of Surabaya-Mojokerto. We still expect Trans Java to be completed in 2019 (while the government's target is 2018).

"In construction" since 1988, Trans Java main corridor (750km) has doubled in the past two years (from 161km in 2014 to 335km in 2016)

And, this looks set to double again in 2018

### Trans Sumatra maybe later (2020)

As for Trans Sumatra, we maintain our forecast that completion will be in 2020. We estimate that Medan-Binjai (16.7km), Medan-Kualanamu-Tebing Tinggi (61.7km) and Palembang-Indralaya (24.5km) sections will be completed in 1Q/2Q18. The government has targeted Jun-Sep2017 for some of these sections.

Nonetheless, given the aggressive push from President Jokowi, completion may end up as targeted.

### Target to double tollroad network in five years from 984km is doable

Given the current progress, we think the government's target to add 1,000km in five years (2015-2019) is still achievable. The completion of Trans Java and Sumatra (priority sections) will add 841km to the current network (984km). Moreover, the government is still issuing (and planning) more tenders.

### We forecast +133.3km in tollroad network this year

We expect national the tollroad network to grow by 133.3km (14%) in 2017.

We assume a more conservative target than the government – basically pushing back to 2018 some of the sections expected to come in 4Q17, eg:

New concessions and upcoming tenders

550km concessions signed in 2016

The government signed concessions for ~550km in 2016 – much higher than its initial plan of 290km. There was hardly any new concession awarded in the prior administration. There are also tollroad projects for ~590km that are either in tender or their tenders are upcoming.

Some projects were proposed by companies

Note that some of the tollroad projects were proposed by companies to the government: eg, Surya Semesta proposed Subang-Patimban (38km), which will help support its future Subang industrial estate, Bumi Serpong proposed Serpong-Balaraja, and Alam Sutera proposed Semanan-Balaraja.

Separately, if a tender does not attract investors, the government may cancel it or itself take on the construction work. Another way to attract investments is by providing subsidies (for the less lucrative sections) in the form of financing/building a certain portion of the tollroad, such as parts of Solo-Kertosono and Semarang-Solo.

# Issue on funding for land clearing

## Resorting back to revolving fund – given limited state budget

While land clearing effort has intensified, the issue remains on funding. As mentioned in our Roads to prosperity: Construction boom paving the way), towards 2H16, the government resorted to its previous practice of revolving funds or "Dana Talangan" (ie, asking investors to pay for land clearing to be reimbursed later by the government). Note that under land reform law No 2 of 2012, land clearing for public projects is the government's responsibility.

While the government has honoured this scheme in the past, this did put an additional burden on the tollroad investor's cash flow. For FY16, tollroad regulator Badan Pengatur Jalan Tol (BPJT) says that it has a commitment of ~Rp31tn for land revolving fund from concession holders. Note that land clearing requirement for all tollroads is ~Rp71tn according to BPJT.

## Hope is now on newly formed LMAN – as the land agency

On 23 December 2016, under Sri Mulyani, Minister of Finance, the State Asset Management Agency (Lembaga Manajemen Aset Negara or LMAN) was formed. Its task is to optimise the use of state assets (to maximise returns) but also planning for funding and use of land, and reimbursing land clearing expenses to investors of public projects.

## LMAN has a Rp13tn budget for land clearing, but deemed not enough

In the 2016 state budget, LMAN received a Rp16tn allocation for land clearing. For 2017, the allocation is Rp20tn (for all national strategic projects), out of which Rp13tn is for toll roads. However, the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing proposes a higher allocation, as it deems that the requirement for this year's land clearing revolving fund is Rp28tn.

## Reimbursement includes interest

To incentivise investors, under Presidential Regulation No 102 (6 December 2016), the reimbursement includes interest at a 7-day BI repo rate (now at 4.75%).

## FY16 spending is yet to be reimbursed

The MoF is yet issue a ministerial decree ("PMK") on the reimbursement mechanism. This has been delayed since December 2016. Land clearing spending under the revolving fund (as of 24 January 2017) was reported at Rp15.6tn. Waskita Karya and Jasa Marga say that they have spent ~Rp6tn each in 2016 on land clearing while Hutama Karya says it has spent Rp2.5tn. We hope the government can resolve this quickly to ensure that the current good progress of tollroad development continues.

## Land clearing has intensified under the new government

### To attract more private-sector players

SOE tollroad investors have been very aggressive:
The two largest state-owned tollroad investors, Waskita and Jasa Marga, have been very aggressive in recent years in adding concessions to their portfolios. This, according to a private tollroad company, has to some extent, crowded out private players – especially on the lucrative projects (eg, Trans Java). Separately, Hutama Karya has been appointed to construct almost all of Trans Sumatra.

But, massive expansion plan implies funding constraints:
However, given their large expansion plans, these SOEs are facing funding constraints. Note that while tollroad investment is lucrative (ie, IRRs are generally higher than those for other infra projects), the investment is cash flow negative in the first few years and improves as traffic gradually grows to the target amount. Therefore, investors need to have strong balance sheets and cash flows from operating tollroads to support the initial cash outflow of new projects.

Figure 14
Returns of infra projects

| Sector   | Project IRR (%) |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Tollroad | 14-17           |
| Power    | 9-12            |
| Port     | 10-13           |

Source: Companies

Waskita divested 29% ownership in WTR:
Waskita recently sold 29% of its stake in Waskita Toll Road to SMI (Sarana Multi Infrastruktur, a non-bank financial institution under the MoF that focuses on infrastructure financing) and Taspen (the State Pension fund), split 16% and 13%, respectively, for Rp3.5tn. This was needed as Waskita only has two tollroads in operation – totaling 55.2km (Kanci-Pejagan, 35km, and section 1 and 2 of Pejagan Pemalang, 20.2km) out of 751km of concessions.

Jasa Marga also plans to divest some:
Unless the government is willing to inject more capital into Jasa Marga, the company plans to divest some stakes in operating assets. Its debt/equity ratio reached 1.3x as of Dec2016.

Expect more private sector participation:
This funding constraint on SOEs opens up the opportunity for private players where we are already seeing increasing interest, given better land clearing process on top of legal certainty (eg, tariff adjustment every two years based on inflation, clear functions of tollroad regulators, open tenders, etc).

Astratel has increased its portfolio by 51% to 343km:
Astratel (a subsidiary of Astra International) has mentioned that tollroad is the company's preferred infrastructure investment. Recently, it beat other bidders in acquiring a total of a 45% stake in the Cikampek-Palimanan tollroad for ~Rp97bn/km from Interra, Surya Semesta and Nusa Raya Cipta. This brings its total portfolio to 343km. Astratel believes that investment in Cikampek-Palimanan makes sense. There is much upside potential for traffic growth as it only became operational in 2015 and there is leverage from completion of the remaining sections of Trans Java. Astratel will continue to look for opportunities (mostly in Java) through M&A or participating in more tenders. It aspires to grow its portfolio to 500km by 2020.

Citra Marga less aggressive vs peers:
Citra Marga added 10.6km of Soreang-Pasirkoja tollroad in West Java (tendered in 2015) to its portfolio. It is now focussing on delivery of this as well as Depok-Antasari (Greater Jakarta). It's been less aggressive vs peers.

Foreign investors can own 100% of tollroads

As part of revisions to the negative investment list in mid-2016, foreign investors can now own up to 100% of a tollroad business, up from 95%. Nonetheless, we are yet to see more investment from foreign investors. Foreign participation in tollroads is in Cikampek-Palimanan (55% owned by Plus Expressway) and China's loan for the Manado-Bitung project's section IB. Its contractor, Sino Road and Bridge Group will be one of the contractors.

However, we are yet to see more result

Continuing improvement in investment climate (including land clearing process) should help

A Turkish construction company, Enka Insast Ve Sanayi is eyeing the Probolinggo-Banyuwangi project (East Java) – in a consortium with Jasa Marga and Waskita Karya. This tollroad is currently in the tender process.

Government also wants to facilitate equity financing for private investors

Realising the need for private-sector funding, the government has also launched the PINA programme (Pembiayaan Infrastruktur Non Anggaran Pemerintah) where the government acts as a facilitator between the potential private investor and the project owner in developing infrastructure projects. The equity financing from Taspen and SMI in WTR was the first project under this programme.

Of the national tollroad network in operation (984km), Jasa Marga has the largest share (580km)

### Figure 15: Share of tollroads in operation (Note: effective ownership)

The policy of CLSA (which for the purpose of this disclosure includes subsidiaries of CLSA B.V. and CLSA Americas, LLC ("CLSA Americas")), and CL Securities Taiwan Co., Ltd. ("CLST") is to only publish research that is impartial, independent, clear, fair, and not misleading. Analysts may not receive compensation from the companies they cover. Regulations or market practice of some jurisdictions/markets prescribe certain disclosures to be made for certain actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interests relating to a research report as below. This research disclosure should be read in conjunction with the research disclaimer as set out at

# Important disclosures

www.clsa.com/disclaimer.html and the applicable regulation of the concerned market where the analyst is stationed and hence subject to. This research disclosure is for your information only and does not constitute any recommendation, representation or warranty. Absence of a discloseable position should not be taken as endorsement on the validity or quality of the research report or recommendation.

To maintain the independence and integrity of CLSA's research, our Corporate Finance, Sales Trading and Research business lines are distinct from one another. This means that CLSA's Research department is not part of and does not report to CLSA Corporate Finance (or "investment banking") department or CLSA's Sales and Trading business. Accordingly, neither the Corporate Finance nor the Sales and Trading department supervises or controls the activities of CLSA's research analysts. CLSA's research analysts report to the management of the Research department, who in turn report to CLSA's senior management.

CLSA has put in place a number of internal controls designed to manage conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of CLSA engaging in Corporate Finance, Sales and Trading and Research activities. Some examples of these controls include: the use of information barriers and other information controls designed to ensure that confidential information is only shared on a "need to know" basis and in compliance with CLSA's Chinese Wall policies and procedures; measures designed to ensure that interactions that may occur among CLSA's Research personnel, Corporate Finance and Sales and Trading personnel, CLSA's financial product issuers and CLSA's research analysts do not compromise the integrity and independence of CLSA's research.

Neither analysts nor their household members/associates/may have a financial interest in, or be an officer, director or advisory board member of companies covered by the analyst unless disclosed herein. In circumstances where an analyst has a pre-existing holding in any securities under coverage, those holdings are grandfathered and the analyst is prohibited from trading such securities.

Unless specified otherwise, CLSA/CLSA Americas/CLST did not receive investment banking/non-investment banking income from, and did not manage/co-manage a public offering for, the listed company during the past 12 months, and it does not expect to receive investment banking compensation from the listed company within the coming three months. Unless mentioned otherwise, CLSA/CLSA Americas/CLST does not own a material discloseable position, and does not make a market, in the securities.

As analyst(s) of this report, I/we hereby certify that the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect my/our own personal views about the securities and/or the issuers and that no part of my/our compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendation or views contained in this report or to any investment banking relationship with the subject company covered in this report (for the past one year) or otherwise any other relationship with such company which leads to receipt of fees from the company except in ordinary course of business of the company. The analyst/s also state/s and confirm/s that he/she/they has/have not been placed under any undue influence, intervention or pressure by any person/s in compiling this research report. In addition, the analysts included herein attest that they were not in possession of any material, nonpublic information regarding the subject company at the time of publication of the report. Save from the disclosure below (if any), the analyst(s) is/are not aware of any material conflict of interest.

CLSA or CLST (and/or their respective affiliates) participated in a public offering of Bumi Serpong Damai Tbk's securities or received compensation for investment banking services from Bumi Serpong Damai Tbk in the past 12 months.

Key to CLSA/CLSA Americas/CLST investment rankings: BUY: Total stock return (including dividends) expected to exceed 20%; O-PF: Total expected return below 20% but exceeding market return; U-PF: Total expected return positive but below market return; SELL: Total return expected to be negative. For relative performance, we benchmark the 12-month total forecast return (including dividends) for the stock against the 12-month forecast return (including dividends) for the market on which the stock trades.

In the case of US stocks, the recommendation is relative to the expected return for the S&P500 of 10%. Exceptions may be made depending upon prevailing market conditions. We define as "Double Baggers" stocks we expect to yield 100% or more (including dividends) within three years at the time the stocks are introduced to our "Double Bagger" list. "High Conviction" Ideas are not necessarily stocks with the most upside/downside, but those where the Research Head/Strategist believes there is the highest likelihood of positive/negative returns. The list for each market is monitored weekly.
