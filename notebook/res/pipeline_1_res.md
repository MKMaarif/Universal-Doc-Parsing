In the current era of Industry 4.0, many new technologies offer manufacturing industries to achieve high processing, productivity. Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the emerging technologies that has been adopted in industries to aid users in acquiring complex skills and carrying out many complicated tasks such product assembly and maintenance. Nevertheless, most AR applications have been developed without clear understanding of how such technology can facilitate improved learnability in terms of knowledge reusability. This paper proposed an enhanced AR-based training system that provides multimodal information with a contextualized information to the software and the software and the software that is used to support the application of the software and decontextualized information. An empirical test was carried out to assess the task performance and the task learnability aspects of this enhanced AR compared to the traditional AR and the paper-based document. The experiment consisted of a training phase where participants carried out an electrical connection task of a sensor and a sensor to detect the sensor. The experiment consisted of a training phase with a sensor and a sensor training. A pre-test quiz was given before the experiment followed by the post-tests phase after the training. Posttests consist of one post-test given directly after the experiment (short-term retention test) and a second post-test unit (four-year one week later (long-term retention test) to measure the performance of the test. The test was performed on the test set of the test set. The test was performed by around 18 % for traditional AR and almost 25 % for enhanced AR as compared to paper-based approach. While all training systems achieved relatively equivalent well for short-term retention test, trainees who used the enhanced AR training systems statistically outperformed those in the paper-based group for long term retention test. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the score of short-term retention test and the score in the knowledge reusability which was also shown by the higher scores in knowledge reusability for the enhanced AR training system compared to the other two approaches. These findings are discussed in relation to the industry 5.05 human centre core value.

knowledge reusability had a statistically significant positive correlation with short-term retention score \((rpb=0.672, n=13, p=0.012)\), but not for long-term retention scores \((rpb=0.466, n=13, p=0.108)\). However, when knowledge retention between short- and long-term was analyzed, Pearson's correlation showed that there was a positive correlation between both, which was statistically significant \((rp=0.717\), \(n=13, p=0.006\) ). Fig. 6 illustrates the comparison for the success rate of wiring a second sensor by comparing the traditional AR, Enhanced AR and Paper based approaches, achieving \(50 \%, 80 \%\) and \(25 \%\) respectively..


## 5. Discussion
Many applications have shown that AR technology can improve learnability when acquiring new skills or concepts over traditional training in terms of knowledge comprehension rate and knowledge retention. The superiority of AR lies in its capability to overlay interrelated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to increase user's motivation to engage with the content which is essential to encourage learning. Besides, allowing users to see the necessary information at a favorable time results in a more efficient use of cognitive resources and in turn accommodates more learning. Nevertheless, the results are based on the results of the proposed method. In this paper, the aspect of productivity such as task performance and knowledge retention enablement. In the light of Industry 5.0 which emphasizes on human centric, sustainability, and resilience, technology is expected to be developed in ways that serve human needs for upskilling or reskilling, and the need for the development of the learning environment. In the current uncertainties [15,. In attempt to expand the knowledge in this area, this study sought to base the development of AR system for training on human centric principles to facilitate meaningful learning and achieve improved learnability in terms of retention test and transfer test (see Table 1).
The results in the retention test showed that all users demonstrated statistically significant understanding in the given task regardless of which training system (see Table 5). However, users in the AR groups were able to get an overall higher number of correct answers (18\% for the first one) and the second one (18\% for the second one) despite completion time and number of mistakes committed were similar across groups. Although the differences were not significant in the short-term test, the higher scores observed in AR groups could be due to more extraneous processing occurred in the paper-based manual group whereas more essential processing occurred in the AR groups. Essential processing involves intrinsic load or essential material/

\begin{abstract}
Further, the task was tested under three different learning interfaces: (1) a paper-based document that serves as a control group against AR systems, (2) a traditional AR-based training system, and (3) an enhanced AR-based training system that was developed by applying design principles that encourage meaningful learning.
\end{abstract}

3.3.1.1. The paper-based document. The paper-based document (see: 10.17862/cranfield.rd.240793971) contains all information about the electronic system and its components. It also consists of a step-by-step information in the form of textual instruction and pictures to complete the electronic system.

3.3.1.2. The traditional AR-based training system. This training system replicated most of AR systems used for learning the assembly tasks which include textual information, graphical objects (e.g., arrow) for pointing certain objects, and videos. Users were initially presented with an overview of the electronic system and its all components using toillops and graphical arrows (See Fig. 2(a)). To acquire skills in wiring the system, assembly instructions were presented step by step on top of the workspace in the form of texts as well as videos which describe the task and how to do it (See Fig. 2(b)). The users can pause and play the video as much as they like and proceed to the next step.

| Component | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Power Supply | Back of the unit | Terminals for +24V and -24V output |
| Breadboard | Visible on the circuit | Used for prototyping the circuit |
| Arduino | Visible on the circuit | Microcontroller board |
| Terminal Block |  Near Power Supply | Connects to the power supply and other components |

Fig. 2. Traditional AR-based training system: (a) the overview of the electronic wiring system, (b) assembly instructions in the textual form and video.

3.3.1.3. The enhanced AR-based training system. The enhanced ARbased training system was similar to the traditional one regarding the contents. However, it had voice cues (multimodal information) that gives additional context and information to the user. For example, during the unscrewing part of the power supply, the voice cue gives additional information on how to perform the task: "To loosen the screws, do two or three counterclockwise turns with the screwdriver on both screws". It also included common mistakes and consequences panel after each step to enable the user to grasp the significance of their actions and increase the understanding of the system behavior (projection of the given states and their consequences) as shown in Fig. 3.

## 3.3.2. Experimental procedure

To examine how third methods of learning affect users in understanding the task and unraveling the acquired knowledge to a different situation, this study assessed independent groups of users (between subjects and their subjects, assigned to each learning method to learn the subjects. Each participant was asked to fill out a demographic questionnaire (see: 10.17862/cranfield.rd.24079371) which includes electronic and augmented reality background questionnaire to check whether they had done some tasks related electronics system and if they were familiar with the use of AR prior to the experiment. After that, each other was used to identify the data and the data generated by the studied wiring task to test their initial knowledge about the system.

The test consisted of questions about the identification of different components they would use during the task and about general knowledge given during the experiment. Following this, a total of thirteen participants were involved in this experiment where four people were assigned in traditional AR group, five people in the enhanced AR group, and four people in the paper-based document group. They were all available for the first two of the three participants. The first two were three. Their knowledge about electronics was balanced across the groups (See Section 4.1). The test was graded over 11 questions and was also given after they finished the task to measure the amount of information they learned after going through a training (short term retention test). One week later, each participant was assessed again with the same questionnaire to test their capability to remember what they learned (long term retention test). The duration of a week has been used in many studies for memory retention test \([11,26,\). Furthermore, participants were not told that the questionnaire would be the same after one week. Existing studies that measured task learnability typically focused on
